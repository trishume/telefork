//! A fun technical joke allowing you to `telefork` a process to a different

//! recommend you use it for anything real at least not without reading the
//! code and noting all the TODO comments for things that aren't handled
//! correctly.
//!
//! I tried to order and comment the source code so that reading this file top
//! to bottom is a good way to understand how it works. This is also why it's
